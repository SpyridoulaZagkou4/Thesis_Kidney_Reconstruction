### reference
This project was based on the PyTorch implementation of Superpixel Sampling Networks (SSN) https://github.com/perrying/ssn-pytorch

paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10174

original code: https://github.com/NVlabs/ssn_superpixels

With some customizations I applied this framework to gray-scale CT images in order to apply automatic segmentation for aorta and arteries.
